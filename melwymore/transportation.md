**Planning our transportation infrastructure around cars alone  is no longer an effective or a sustainable option. Everyone should be able to get where theyâ€™re going easily and safely, whatever mode of transportation they use.**

Sound transportation is not only about safety and quality of life. It is also about fairness. We should do everything possible to ensure that our transportation system serves those with limited options. Mel will enter the council on day one bringing decades of success on transportation issues.

 

**What Mel Will Do About It**

- Make pedestrian, bike, and mass transit alternatives the top priority.
- Crack down on double parking, speeding, and rogue cyclists.
- Reform parking to serve those who most need it.

**What Mel Has Already Done**

- Spearheaded the the first street redesign on Columbus Avenue, including the new bike lanes.
- Championed closing the Central Park Loop to cars.
- Implemented safety renovations across the district, including slow zones, bump outs, countdown timers, sidewalk benches, and pedestrian islands.
