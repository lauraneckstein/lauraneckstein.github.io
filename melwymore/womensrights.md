**As a mother with a unique experience of gender and a lifelong gender-equality advocate, Melâ€™s experience as a transgender person makes him a uniquely qualified champion of modern intersectional feminism.**

Mel has seen first-hand how traditional gender roles and sexism can handicap people of all genders, and has worked diligently to reach beyond traditional lines of feminism to build a broad coalition of women, men, and transgender advocates. Mel will never compromise on fundamental issues from equal pay to the right to choose, and strongly believes that it is past time to finally pass the Equal Rights Amendment, which has laid fallow for far too long.
