**Mel is the only candidate in this race who owes nothing to real estate developers - he never has and never will accept contributions from developers.**

If we want the Upper West Side to remain a great place to live, we must stand up to real estate greed. Too often, new developments replace affordable housing, push out our neighbors, overcrowd our schools, and darken our streets .  If we donâ€™t act now, the essential character of the West Side will change irreversibly.

 

**What Mel Will Do About It**

- Stop super tall buildings on the Upper West Side.
- Reform zoning to include community review of all high-density developments.
- Require public disclosure of all transfers of development rights.
- Prohibit bad-acting landlords from acquiring new permits.

**What Mel Has Already Done**

- Staved off the sale of air rights over a park, and instead negotiated funds to rebuild the Gertrude Ederle Recreation Center on 59th Street.
- Forced the developers of Riverside Center to include 600 units of permanent affordable housing, the first new Upper West Side public school in 30 years, and $20 million for Riverside Park.
- Successfully advocated for historic districts that promote rational development and preserve neighborhood character.
