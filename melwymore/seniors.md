People on fixed incomes are especially vulnerable to escalating prices. Mel is the only candidate in the race who refuses money from real estate interests that drive up costs on the Upper West Side.  And for decades, Mel has brought together all members of our community to ensure continued access and service for seniors.

- Ensure that streets, parks, playgrounds, new developments, and community facilities are accessible.
- Phase in a 100% wheelchair-accessible taxi fleet and Accessible Dispatch System.
