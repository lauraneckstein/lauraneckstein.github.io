**Mel has been a member of Community Board 7 for twenty-one years, during which time he served as Chair of the Board and Chair of the Budget and Strategy Committee. Mel is intimately familiar with New York City’s budgeting process.**

In 2011, Mel served on the citywide steering committee that introduced Participatory Budgeting to New York City, because he knows that we should all have a voice in how our tax dollars are spent.

 

**What Mel Will Do About It**

- Take participatory budgeting to the next level by incorporating voters’ voices into the overall $85 billion budget, rather than restricting it to $1 million.
- Collaborate with community leaders and state-level elected officials to identify forgotten needs and ensure that our tax dollars are being used for maximum impact.
- Make budget data transparent and understandable for citizen review.

**What Mel Has Already Done**

- Helped bring Participatory Budgeting to New York City.
- Twice successfully advocated to increase the budget for all 59 community boards.
- Brought together Manhattan’s community boards to streamline the budgeting process, improve collection and presentation of district needs, and integrate budget priorities.
